# Age Detection Using Face Images
This age detection project is being developed for the Spring 2024, CSC481: Artificial Intelligence, class at Southern Connecticut State University.
The aim of this project is to predict the age of a person based off face image data. To accomplish this, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model
is being developed, that when given face image data, outputs the predicted age of a person. The dataset to be used for the CNN model is the 
publically available UTKFace dataset.
